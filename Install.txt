mkscript, FileComposer

I wrote this program with intention of making life easier for programmers 
who work with many languages and technologies and often forget the
unique syntax of each one.

after installing it you can put your scripts inside /yourhome/user/.app-filecomposer
you will set they as templates for new ones..

OBS: Do not forget to use one extension per script like: 
foo.pl, 
foo.c, 
foo.lua, foo.sh etc...


NOTE
In future versions I plan to include dependency management for 
different programming languages...
